Hello!

Please place the folders as is in your working directory without taking the data out from the folders. The code directly accesses the data from the folders.

Since the GTD data is a huge dataset, I subsetted the data, saved it as csv and load it in. I've commented out the lines of code that do this and just load in the data. If you do want to use the original GTD data, I'd recommend to uncomment the lines and run the code but it will take a while to run.
